Queue:
    Queue is a linear data structure that stores the data in First in First Out order.
    eg:
        printing pages in printer.
        downloading files in some application.
    
    - Operations implemented on the queue:
        1. engueue() - adding an element to the end of the queue.
        2. dequeue() - removing an element from the front of the queue.
        3. front() - Retrieving the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
        4. rear() - Retrieving the element at the rear of the queue without removing it.
        5. empty() - return true if queue is empty, otherwise it return false.

Asymptotic Notation:
    The complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of the time taken by a program to run as a function of the length of the input.
