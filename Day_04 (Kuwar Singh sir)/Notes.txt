Q1. Why are we here? - To upskill ourself
Q2. Why do we need skills? - 

Languages to start with - javascript, java or python, c++, Csharp

For starting DSA - Primitive and non primitive types of data storage, function, structures, pointers.

Q1. How data types and data structures are different

Reference - It is a derived datatype
Pointer - It is a derived datatype

Methods - It is a synonyms for functions. Function inside a class is known as method.

** Ways to declare and define methods in C++ **
1. Inside class method - 
2. Outside class method - the methods which are declared inside the same class but are defined outisde the class with the help of class name using scope resolution operator.

Constructor - it is a special type of member function or method in C++ which is automatically invoke or called when an object of the class is created.

** Key Points wrt Constructor **
1. Constructor_name == class_name  in C++
2. Automatically invoke at the time of object creation.
3. For constructors memory will be only allocated at the time of object creation.
4. They do not have any return type.
5. WRT to parametrized constructor we can pass the arguments at the time of object creation with the help of parenthesis.
6. Constructors should always be public.

** Types of Constructors **
1. Default - it is automatically invoked or implicitly passed by the language processor (compiler) when we do not create any constructor. 
2. Parametrized - a constructor does not have any parameter.
3. Copy - A type of constructor which creates a copy of an existing object.
3.1 Default Copy Constructor - whenever we create a copy of an object so technically the compiler will automatically create a copy of an object using references.
3.2 Custom Copy Constructor - a custom copy constructor is created by a programmer but it is optional for him.
Shallow copy - You modify the copy and the original value will be changed.
Deep copy -
