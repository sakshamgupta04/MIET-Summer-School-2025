Variable: They are same as containers which is used to store any type of data.

Pointer: Special type of variable which is used to store address of another variable

Reference ( & ): It return the address of given variable.

Dereference ( * ): It return value at given address.

                                                ***Types of Pointers***
1. Null Pointer: 
    Pointer initialize with NULL pointer.
    It is good practice to initialize pointer with NULL to avoid wild pointer (wrong memory location).

2. Void Pointer:
    Pointer defined using void keyword.
    Syntax: void *ptr_name = NULL;
    Also known as Generic pointer.

3. Dangling Pointer:
    Pointer which indicate memory which is deallocated.

4. Constant Variable:
    It is defined using const keyword.
    We cannot override the value of constant variable.

5. Constant Pointer:
    It is same as constant variable.
    Syntax:
        const data_type *ptr_name = & variable_name;

Pointer of Pointer:
    It is also known as double pointer, use to store address of any pointer.
    Synatx: 
        data_type ** pointer_name = & another_pointer_name;
