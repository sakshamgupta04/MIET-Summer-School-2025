What is Greedy Algorithm?
    A Greedy Algorithm is an approach for solving problems by making the locally optimal choice at each step, with the hope that these local choices will lead to a globally
    optimal solution.
    
    In Other Words:
        Take the best possible choice at the current moment -- repeat -- until the problem is solved.
        
Greedy Choice Properties:
    - The problem has the Greedy choice property.
    - The problem has Optimal Substructure.
    - You need an efficient solution (usually faster than brute force or DP).
    
Optimal Substructure:
    A problem has an optimal solution that contains optimal solutions to its subproblems.
    
Example: 
    1. You are given a list of activities with start and end time array. Select the max number of activities that dont overlap.
    - Always pick the activity that finishes earlier.
