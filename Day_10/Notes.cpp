TEMPLATE:
    Template is a base of generic programming in C++.

GENERIC PROGRAMMING:
    Programming which is independent of data type is called generic programming.

In C++, implementation of template is performed via two methods:
    1. Generic Function
    2. Generic Class

STACK:
    It is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.
    Stack has one end only.
    It contains only one pointer pointing to the top most element of the stack.

    Example:
        Recursion
        Do and Un-Do mechanism.

    Stack Functions:
        1. Push(): Use to store element in stack.
        2. Pop(): Use to remove the element from the top of the stack.
        3. Top(): Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
        4. empty(): Returns true if stack is empty otherwise false.
        5. size(): Returns number of elements of stack.
