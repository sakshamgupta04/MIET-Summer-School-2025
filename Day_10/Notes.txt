TEMPLATE:
    Template is a base of generic programming in C++.

GENERIC PROGRAMMING:
    Programming which is independent of data type is called generic programming.

In C++, implementation of template is performed via two methods:
    1. Generic Function
    2. Generic Class

STACK:
    It is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.
    Stack has one end only.
    It contains only one pointer pointing to the top most element of the stack.

    Example:
        Recursion
        Do and Un-Do mechanism.

    Stack Functions:
        1. Push(): Use to store element in stack.
        2. Pop(): Use to remove the element from the top of the stack.
        3. Top(): Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
        4. empty(): Returns true if stack is empty otherwise false.
        5. size(): Returns number of elements of stack.

    Polished Notation:
        This type of notation was introduced by the Polish mathematician Lukasiewicz.
        - Polish notation in data structure tells us about different ways to write an arithematic expression.
        - An arithematic expression contains 2 things:
            1. Operator:
                It is a symbol that represents a specific operation to be performed.
                eg - +, -, *, /, ^, %
            2. Operand:
                Operand is a value or a variable on which an operation is performed by an Operator.
                eg- 0 to 9, a to z, A to Z

        - There are mainly three type of polish notation.
        1. Infix Notation:
            This polish notation in data structures states that the operator is written in between the operands.
            eg- ( a + b ) x c ( a + b ) x C
                a + b - c + d
                ( a x b ) + ( c / d ) ( a x b )

        2. Prefix Notation:
            This notation in data structure states that the operator should be present as a prefix or before the operands.
            eg- + a b
                + - a b c + - a b c
                x a b x a b

        3. Postfix notation:
            This notation in data structures states that the operator should be present as after the operands.
            Postfix notation is a computer understandable format.
            eg- a b -
                a b / c d /
                12 5 + 3 / 12 5 + 3 /
                8 2 3 x + 8 2 3 x +
